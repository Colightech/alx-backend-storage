#Project name
0x01. NoSQL

#project introduction:
0x01 NoSQL refers to a category of database management systems that diverge from the traditional relational database model. Unlike relational databases, which use structured query language (SQL) and predefined schemas to manage data, NoSQL databases offer flexible schemas and are designed to handle a variety of data models, including key-value pairs, document-oriented, column-family, and graph formats. This flexibility makes NoSQL databases particularly well-suited for handling large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data, enabling rapid scaling and performance optimization for modern applications such as real-time analytics, content management, and social media platforms. The term "0x01" often signifies the beginning of a subject in technical documentation, indicating foundational knowledge about NoSQL databases.
